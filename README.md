# H1B_Visa_Prediction_Machine_Learning

● Worked on H1B Dataset where we worked with around 300000 rows of data collected on Kaggle 
● Analyzed & preprocessed the data, removed outliers by outlier detection, and applied and used feature selection to select the best features. 
● Removed the imbalance issue in the dataset by using the under-sampling technique. 
● Applied KNN, Naïve Bayes, Decision Trees, Neural Networks, and SVM Machine Learning classification algorithms to predict the label.
